That can be built with PackageCompiler.

Usage:
  julia arithmetic.jl + 2 5
    7
  julia arithmetic.jl - 2 5
    -3
  julia arithmetic.jl x 2 5
    10
  julia arithmetic.jl / 2 5

module Arithmetic
  function calc(ARGS)
    op_str = ARGS[1]
    numbers = map(arg->parse(Int64, arg), ARGS[2:end])
    operation = Dict("+" => +, "-" => -, "x" => *, "/" => /, "%" => %, "^" => ^)[op_str]
    return (operation(numbers...))
  end

  not_importing_module = (PROGRAM_FILE == "arithmetic.jl")
  if not_importing_module && (ARGS[1] != "alintmetic.jl")
    println(calc(ARGS))
